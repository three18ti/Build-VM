App to build RBD based libvirt virtual machines

App is able to build disks and vm.  See t/01_build_vm.t for usage examples.
Currently requires base vm to be built, snapshot name to be specified.

TODO:
    - Rewrite bin/vm-gen.pl to take cli / yaml config parameters
    - handle snapshot name generation / discovery
    - tool to build base vm for cloning, handle vm snapshotting/protect
    - update build_disk_list to build list using ++ iterator
    - refactor template to use external disk template, this will also allow tool to create / attach disk on the fly
        - refactor template to utilize external templates?  Would allow for more versatile config
    - implement sys-prep
        - automatic ip discovery?
    - make module "cluster aware"
        - will need to impliment some sort of way to chose host/handle single host "clusters"
    - tool to manage vm-migration
